A pure Python library for **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**, built from scratch with a focus on security, clarity, and modern Python practices.

This library provides the essential cryptographic primitives for digital signatures and key exchange, implemented with secure, constant-time algorithms and a clean, object-oriented API. It's an excellent tool for learning the fundamentals of ECC or for projects that require a clear and auditable cryptographic implementation.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Secure by Default**:
    * **Constant-Time** scalar multiplication (Montgomery Ladder) to prevent timing side-channel attacks.
    * **Deterministic Signatures (RFC 6979)** to eliminate risks from faulty random number generators.
    * **Non-Malleable Signatures** ("low-s" normalization) to prevent signature tampering.
* **Modern API**: A clean, object-oriented interface for key management, signing, and verification.
* **Key Exchange**: Built-in support for **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** key exchange with a standard HKDF.
* **Core Primitives**: Includes all necessary building blocks, such as `FieldElement` and `Point` arithmetic.
* **Standard Curves**: Comes with built-in support for the `secp256k1` curve.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the library from PyPI using `uv`:
```bash
uv add eccrypto
```
or by using `pip`:
```bash
pip install eccrypto
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here are some examples of how to use the library for common cryptographic tasks.

### üîë Key Generation
First, import the `secp256k1` curve and the `generate_keypair` helper function.

```python
from ecc import secp256k1
from ecc import generate_keypair

# Generate a new private and public key pair
private_key, public_key = generate_keypair(secp256k1)

print("Private Key:", private_key)
print("Public Key:", public_key)
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è ECDSA Signing & Verification
Use the key pair to create and verify a digital signature.

```python
# Assume `private_key` and `public_key` from the step above
message = b":D"

# Alice signs the message with her private key
signature = private_key.sign(message)
print(f"Signature: {signature}")

# Bob verifies the signature with Alice's public key
is_valid = public_key.verify(message, signature)

if is_valid:
    print("‚úÖ Signature is valid!")
else:
    print("‚ùå Signature is invalid!")
```

### ü§ù ECDH Key Exchange
Establish a shared secret between two parties (Alice and Bob).

```python
# Alice and Bob both generate their own key pairs
alice_priv, alice_pub = generate_keypair(secp256k1)
bob_priv, bob_pub = generate_keypair(secp256k1)

# Alice computes the secret using her private key and Bob's public key
secret_by_alice = alice_priv.ecdh(bob_pub)

# Bob computes the secret using his private key and Alice's public key
secret_by_bob = bob_priv.ecdh(alice_pub)

# The secrets must be identical
assert secret_by_alice == secret_by_bob
print(f"\n‚úÖ Shared secret derived successfully: 0x{secret_by_alice.hex()}")
```
